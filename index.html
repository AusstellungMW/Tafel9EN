Managing the influx of German refugees and displaced persons from the eastern territories occupied by the Soviet Army was one of the greatest challenges of the postwar period for the city of Wolfenbüttel. Largely spared from Allied bombing raids, Wolfenbüttel, the largest city in the district, was initially designated as a transit station for 25,000 men, women, and children in December 1945. However, the situation escalated dramatically during Aktion Schwalbe in 1946, when approximately 215,000 people from the former German eastern territories—now under Polish administration—were relocated to the western zones between February and November.

With forced housing allocations and widespread shortages of food, heating materials, furniture, household goods, clothing, shoes, and other essential items, conflicts between locals and the new arrivals were inevitable. Tensions ran particularly high as many homeowners suddenly found themselves forced to share their living spaces, kitchens, and toilets with strangers who had been assigned to their homes.

The peak number of displaced Germans from the eastern territories was reached on October 1, 1948, when the city recorded 11,462 refugees and displaced persons. The largest group among them comprised 2,446 men, women, and children from the former administrative district of Breslau in Lower Silesia. Another significant group included 2,121 refugees from the province of East Prussia.

By the third postwar year, Wolfenbüttel's total population had risen to 34,804. With additional newcomers included, nearly one in three residents at that time was a refugee or displaced person. </p>
